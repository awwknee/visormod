# Visor Mod
a silly little mod to add some ovals on my screen because I have severe motion sickness when playing minecraft and this is the only way I can play. :D

maybe I add more stuff to it later, who knows?

Setup Process:
==============================

Step 1: Open your command-line and browse to the folder where you extracted the zip file.

Step 2: You're left with a choice.
If you prefer to use Eclipse:
1. Run the following command: `./gradlew genEclipseRuns`
2. Open Eclipse, Import > Existing Gradle Project > Select Folder 
   or run `gradlew eclipse` to generate the project.

If you prefer to use IntelliJ:
1. Open IDEA, and import project.
2. Select your build.gradle file and have it import.
3. Run the following command: `./gradlew genIntellijRuns`
4. Refresh the Gradle Project in IDEA if required.

If at any point you are missing libraries in your IDE, or you've run into problems you can 
run `gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to refresh the local cache. `gradlew clean` to reset everything 
(this does not affect your code) and then start the process again.
